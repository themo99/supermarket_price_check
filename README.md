# supermarket_price_check
Initially this project was built for the following description. I since found I didn't have permission to scrape these sites, and after many tries decided to scrape a webscraping sandbox site. 


Check prices from local supermarkets to find cheapest groceries

This repository scrapes prices of groceries from the 3 main supermarket chains in Christchurch.

It then compares prices for each item, and returns a list saying where to get each item from. 


As stated earlier, the project took a change here, and now its getting names and prices of games from a site. 

For practice, I will randomly select 5 games from this site. I will then compare each item with another 5 items from another scraping sandbox site. I will try to find another site with similar prices, so some of the time site A will be more expensive and some of the time site B will be more expensive. This will give me comparison data, and will let me gather insights into which sandbox site is more expensive. 

Prices won't be real, and they likely wont even be similar products at all, but this is all for practice.


#TO DO

- scrape multiple pages
